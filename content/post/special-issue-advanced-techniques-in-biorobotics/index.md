Dear Colleagues,

Biorobotics represents a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field, combining the principles of robotics, electronics, biology, and bioengineering to develop systems that interact seamlessly with biological environments. Recent advances in electronic technologies, such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), and flexible electronics, have driven significant progress in this area. These technologies are crucial for creating biohybrid robots, biosensors, bio-controllers, and biomimetic robots capable of performing complex tasks in medical, industrial, and environmental applications. The integration of electrical components and systems in biorobotics allows for powerful actuation, enhanced sensing capabilities, more precise control, and better adaptation to biological environments, which ultimately enhances the functionality and potential of these systems. As the demand for innovative and reliable bio-robotic systems grows, it is imperative to highlight the role of electronics in overcoming current challenges and paving the way for future developments.

This Special Issue in *Electronics* aims to present the latest advances in electronic technologies as they pertain to biorobotics. We seek to provide a platform for researchers to share their findings and insights into how electronic components and systems can be optimized and applied to biohybrid robots, biosensors, bio-controllers, and biomimetic robots. This Special Issue aligns with the scope of *Electronics* and will showcase research that highlights the importance of electronics in advancing the field of biorobotics.

In this Special Issue, we welcome original research articles and reviews that explore the latest advances and challenges in the intersection of electronics and biorobotics. Suggested themes for this Special Issue include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

* Electronic interfaces for biohybrid robots/actuators;
* Advanced electric actuation and driving technologies for biorobots;
* Advanced electronic biosensing technologies;
* Bioinspired and neuromorphic electronic control systems;
* Flexible and stretchable electronics in soft biorobotic systems;
* Integration of MEMS/NEMS in miniaturized biorobotic systems;
* Novel electronic materials for biorobotic interfaces;
* Control algorithms and strategies for electrically driven biorobots;
* Electronic fabrication techniques for biocompatible robotic components;
* Signal processing techniques for interpreting biological signals;
* Wireless communication systems for biorobots in medical and environmental applications.

We look forward to receiving your contributions.
