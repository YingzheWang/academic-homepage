abstract: In this work, a novel micro-assembly method using
  molecular-motor-powered artificial muscles is presented. A UV scanning system
  was set up to fast optically pattern artificial muscles from microtubules and
  kinesins. With this system, micro-components could be accurately assembled by
  fabricated artificial muscles in microfluidic channel. The successful
  assemblies of hexagon micro-components have proved the feasibility of this
  method. We believe this new micro-assembly with simple operation and low cost
  has a great potential in MEMS applications.
