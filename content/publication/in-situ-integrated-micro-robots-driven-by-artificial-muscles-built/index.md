abstract: Microrobots have been developed for applications in the submillimeter
  domain such as the manipulation of micro-objects and microsurgery. Rapid
  progress has been achieved in developing miniaturized components for
  microrobotic systems, resulting in a variety of functional microactuators and
  soft components for creating untethered microrobots. Nevertheless, the
  integration of microcomponents, especially the assembly of actuators and
  mechanical components, is still time-consuming and has inherent restrictions,
  thus limiting efficient fabrications of microrobots and their potential
  applications. Here, we propose a method for fabricating microrobots in situ
  inspired by the construction of microsystems in living organisms. In a
  microfluidic chip, hydrogel mechanical components and artificial muscle
  actuators are successively photopatterned from hydrogel prepolymer and
  biomolecular motors, respectively, and integrated in situ into functional
  microrobots. The proposed method allows the fast fabrication of microrobots
  through simple operations and affordable materials while providing versatile
  functions through the precise spatiotemporal control of in situ integration
  and reconfiguration of artificial muscles. To validate the method, we
  fabricated microrobots to elicit different motions and on-chip robots with
  unique characteristics for microfluidic applications. This study may establish
  a new paradigm for microrobot integration and lead to the production of unique
  biohybrid microrobots with various advantages.
