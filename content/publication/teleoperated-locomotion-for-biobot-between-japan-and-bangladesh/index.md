abstract: Biobot-based insects have been investigated so far for various
  applications such as search and rescue operations, environmental monitoring,
  and discovering the environment. These applications need a strong
  international collaboration to complete the tasks. However, during the
  COVID-19 pandemic, most people could not easily move from one country to
  another because of the travel ban. In addition, controlling biobots is
  challenging because only experts can operate the cockroach behavior with and
  without stimulated response. In order to solve this issue, we proposed a
  user-friendly teleoperation user interface (UI) to monitor and control the
  biobot between Japan and Bangladesh without onsite operation by experts. This
  study applied Madagascar hissing cockroaches (MHC) as a biobot hybrid robot. A
  multithreading algorithm was implemented to run multiple parallel computations
  concurrently on the UI. Virtual network computing (VNC) was implemented on the
  teleoperation UI as remote communication for streaming real-time video from
  Japan to Bangladesh and sending remote commands from Bangladesh to Japan. In
  the experiments, a remote operator successfully steered the biobot to follow a
  predetermined path through a developed teleoperation UI with a time delay of
  275 ms. The proposed interactive and intuitive UI enables a promising and
  reliable system for teleoperated biobots between two remote countries.
