abstract: A printable artificial muscle assembled from biomolecular motors,
  which we have recently developed, showed great potential in overcoming the
  design limitations of conventional biohybrid robots as a new bio-actuator.
  Characterizing its contractility for extending its applicability is important.
  However, conventional measurement methods are comprised of complex operations
  with poor reproducibility, flexibility, and real-time responsiveness. This
  study presents a new method for measuring the contractile force generated by
  artificial muscles. A measurement system was constructed, wherein artificial
  muscles were patterned by UV laser scanning in an oil-sealed microchamber, and
  the contractile force was measured in real-time using a micro-force sensor
  extended by a 3D printed micro-cantilever. The measurement accuracy of the
  sensor was ensured through calibration and correction. For demonstration
  purposes, a series of contractile measurements were carried out using the
  proposed system. The relationship between contractile force and the dimensions
  of the activation space of the artificial muscles, as well as the tensile
  properties of the contracted muscle chain were evaluated. The results will
  help characterize the contractile properties of the artificial muscle and lay
  the foundations for its further application in biohybrid robotics.
