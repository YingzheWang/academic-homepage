abstract: In this paper, we proposed a new venous valve-like
  check-valve(V<sup>2</sup>CV) for microfluidic device which consist of two
  valve flaps made from PDMS. Compared to conventional check valves in
  microfluidic devices, this V<sup>2</sup>CV has simpler structure and easier
  fabrication, make it possible to be applied in different kinds of microfluidic
  devices. Experiments were carried out to test its capacity of allowing forward
  flow and blocking reverse flow.
