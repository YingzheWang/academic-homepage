abstract: Leveraging the motion and force of individual molecular motors in a
  controlled manner to perform macroscopic tasks can provide substantial
  benefits to many applications, including robotics. Nonetheless, although
  millimetre-scale movement has been demonstrated with synthetic and biological
  molecular motors, their efficient integration into engineered systems that
  perform macroscopic tasks remains challenging. Here, we describe an active
  network capable of macroscopic actuation that is hierarchically assembled from
  an engineered kinesin, a biomolecular motor, and microtubules, resembling the
  contractile units in muscles. These contracting materials can be formed in
  desired areas using patterned ultraviolet illumination, allowing their
  incorporation into mechanically engineered systems, being also compatible with
  printing technologies. Due to the designed filamentous assembly of kinesins,
  the generated forces reach the micronewton range, enabling actuation of
  millimetre-scale mechanical components. These properties may be useful for the
  fabrication of soft robotic systems with advanced functionalities.
