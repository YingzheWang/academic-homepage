abstract: Micro check valves play a pivotal role in many microfluidic systems.
  However, there is still an unmet need for low-cost check valves with good
  performance and easy integration. In this work, we present a planar micro
  check valve using a hydrogel valve core fabricated in situ in a microchannel.
  This valve is characterized by a simple fabrication process and easy
  integration with other microfluidic devices. Experimental results proved that
  the check valve performs better than most existing in-plane micro check
  valves, especially in low-pressure operations, with nearly zero forward
  cracking pressure and reverse leakage, adjustable forward fluidic resistance,
  and good repeatability. We further proposed a normally-closed check valve with
  controllable cracking pressure to meet different requirements of microfluidic
  devices. Precise cracking pressures could be achieved by regulating the valve
  spring width. To demonstrate the valve usefulness, we employed these valves to
  make a finger-actuated micro-mixer and a bio-actuated micro-pump. This study
  makes the flow control more simplified in integrated microfluidic systems.
