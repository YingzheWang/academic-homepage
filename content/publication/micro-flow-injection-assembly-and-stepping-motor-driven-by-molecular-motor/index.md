abstract: In this research, we proposed a method for fabricating microrobots by
  in-situ integrating photo-patterned artificial muscle actuators with
  photo-patterned hydrogel mechanisms in microfluidics. Compared to conventional
  methods, our method greatly reduces the time and difficulty of the
  integration, and thereby increases the efficiency and flexibility of the
  fabrication. Meanwhile, this in-situ can be controlled with high spatial
  precision and allows for rapid reconfiguration of actuators. Different
  microrobots were fabricated to perform motions including gripping, cyclic
  swinging, and walking. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and
  versatility of the proposed method.
