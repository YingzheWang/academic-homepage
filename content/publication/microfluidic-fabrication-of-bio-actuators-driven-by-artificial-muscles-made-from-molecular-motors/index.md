abstract: In this paper, we developed a microfluidic chip based method for
  fabrication of bio-actuators driven by artificial muscles made from molecular
  motors. Different from conventional complex methods, we integrates the
  fabrication and actuation of bio-actuators into a single microfluidic chip
  using UV-induced projection printing with a maskless optical system. A
  micro-gripper was fabricated and actuated in a microfluidic chip as an example
  of application. This low-cost and easy-operated method is able to make
  different kinds of bio-actuators for microfluidic devices.
