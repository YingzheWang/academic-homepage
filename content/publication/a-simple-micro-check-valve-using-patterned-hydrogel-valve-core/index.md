abstract: In this paper, we present a simple in-plane micro check valve using a
  hydrogel valve core fabricated by photolithography. Compared to early micro
  check valves with multilayered structure, this simple structured valve is much
  easier to fabricate and operate. Experimental results show that this check
  valve performs better than most existing in-plane micro check valves, with
  nearly zero forward cracking pressure and reverse leakage. The forward fluidic
  resistance of the valve is easy to control by adjusting the width of valve
  neck. We believe this type of micro check valve could have great use of flow
  control in integrated microfluidic systems and generate more potentials for
  MEMS to be utilized in real application.
