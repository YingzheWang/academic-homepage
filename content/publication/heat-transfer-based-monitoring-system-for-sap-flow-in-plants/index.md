abstract: Sap flow, the movement of water and nutrients through the vascular
  tissues of plants, is closely associated with key physiological processes such
  as photosynthesis and transpiration. Monitoring of sap flow is essential for
  understanding plant health and optimizing agricultural practices. However,
  conventional sap flow sensors are often rigid and invasive, making them
  incompatible with the soft, curved surfaces of plant stems and petioles. In
  this study, we propose a new thermal-based sap flow sensor capable of
  non-invasive, real-time monitoring. Through heat conduction simulations and
  controlled experiments, we demonstrate that the downstream temperature of the
  sensor decreases as flow rate increases, establishing a negative correlation
  between temperature and sap flow.
