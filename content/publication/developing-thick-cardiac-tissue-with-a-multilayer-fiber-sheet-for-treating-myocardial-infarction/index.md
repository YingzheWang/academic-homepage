  Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiac patches have been
  extensively used for treating myocardial infarction and have shown potential
  for clinical application. However, the limited patch thickness can hamper its
  therapeutic effect. We previously developed a fibrous scaffold that allowed
  the formation of well-organized cardiac tissue constructs. In the present
  study, based on the above technology, we developed a three-dimensional
  multilayer fibrous scaffold with dynamic perfusion, on which approximately 20
  million hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) could be seeded in a single step
  and organized into 1 mm thick and viable tissue. The multilayer cardiac tissue
  demonstrated enhanced contractile properties and upregulated cytokine
  secretion compared with the control group. Notably, when used on the
  myocardial infarction model, the multilayer group showed improved functional
  recovery and less fibrosis. These results indicated that the appropriate
  hiPSC-CM dose requires careful evaluation in developing clinical therapy. The
  multilayer cardiac tissue group demonstrated significant improvement than the
  control group, indicating that higher doses of transplanted cells may have
  improved therapeutic effects in treating myocardial infarction.
