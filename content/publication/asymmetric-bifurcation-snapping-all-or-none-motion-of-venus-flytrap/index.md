abstract: The Venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant that catches insects by
  snapping rapidly and reopening slowly. To understand the mechanism underlying
  this asymmetrically reversible motion, a three-dimensional laser profiler was
  used to measure both static morphological information and dynamic movements
  (500 frames per second) of the Venus flytrap, including its rapid closure and
  slow re-opening. The mean-curvature differences between the open and closed
  lobes were recorded and used for morphology and energy evaluations. The
  effects of geometric parameters such as the length, width, height, and
  thickness of the lobes on the closing time were analyzed, and the all-or-none
  motion of the Venus flytrap was examined. Moreover, a mathematical
  asymmetric-bifurcation buckling model was developed. The Venus flytrap has
  asymmetric energy states for the closing and opening conditions; therefore,
  storage of a larger amount of energy makes the re-opening motion slower. These
  pre-programmed movements of plants can facilitate the development of more
  intelligent soft robots.
