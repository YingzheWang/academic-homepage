abstract: Bio-inspired and bio-hybrid principles are used to design robots that
  imitate biological systems. Animals and insects are commonly selected as the
  prototype in this context due to their mobility. However, plants have been
  found to grow slowly but move rapidly based on hydraulics and mechanics. The
  Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is an example of a carnivorous plant that
  eats insects, but the mechanism underlying its quick predation behavior has
  not been adequately explored in research. It is particularly important to
  determine how cells of this plant are grouped together, from the level of the
  cell to that of the tissue as well as from the microscopic to the macroscopic
  scale, such that they can perform this motion without the help of muscles. In
  this study, we map the cellular characteristics and cell distribution of the
  Venus flytrap. We propose an area-weighted central point to describe a
  units-driven principle of actuation and develop a computational model to
  verify it. We fabricate and test a physical model that patterned the cellular
  structure of the Venus flytrap to explore this mechanism by using chemically
  fixed and immobile samples. The hydrogel-based actuator replicates the
  deformation of the plant cell under turgor pressure. The statistical results
  show that the area-weighted center of the plant involves a shift, and this
  distribution actuates the bending-induced deformation of its lobes.
